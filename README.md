Terminalize is **a simple and lightweight CSS3 micro-framework** for doing terminal-like interfaces. [You can check a live version with examples here.](http://terminalize.ml/)

## Motivation

Terminalize was, in his humble beginnings, an old personal website I did based on a old codepen.

The main purpose of that website, at that time, was only to show my former CSS and web development skills. So I also created a blog with curious posts about code and projects.

But as I discovered not so many time later, the big majority of devices screens at that time showed the website too blurry and out of focus. So I had to discard that design and create a new website from scratch.

Some time ago I re-discovered this project buried in my files and decided to transform it in a some kind of micro-css framework for quick terminal style alike websites.

## Features

* Default and alternate styles for most HTML tags
* Fully styled forms and form inputs including buttons and selects.
* Responsive design using `.pannel`, `.row` and `.col` classes
* Unique styled code blocks
* Optional animations, filters and much more to obtain a retro terminal style

## How To use it

I designed **Terminalize** to be used with any other framework or existing style, so you only need to put a class `.terminalize` in the parent to have all the children correctly styled. Then inside you have to use a first `div` element with a `.screen` class to correctly apply the theme background color.
